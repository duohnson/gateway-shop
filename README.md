# Gateway Shop

This repository is a practice project for building a payment gateway for a small fictional shop. The main goal is to create a reusable codebase that can be adapted for future payment gateway implementations in other projects.

## Project Purpose
- Develop a simple, secure, and modular payment gateway system.
- Use best practices and clear code structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Avoid "vibe coding"; all code should be purposeful and well-documented.

## Features
- Basic shop interface for testing payment flows.
- Payment gateway integration (mock or real, depending on requirements).
- Modular design for easy reuse in future projects.

## Rules
1. No "vibe coding". All code must be intentional, clear, and maintainable.
2. The project and documentation must be written in English.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions in the documentation.
3. Start building and testing the payment gateway.

## Future Use
The code developed here will serve as a foundation for future payment gateway projects, making integration and customization easier.
